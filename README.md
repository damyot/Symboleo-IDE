# Symboleo Text Editor
This IDE for the formal contract specification language Symboleo was created using Eclipse's [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) DSL generator.
For installating and using the IDE, please take a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Symboleo-IDE/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

# What is Symboleo?
Symboleo is a formal contract specification language developed in the [Contract Specification and Modelling (CSM) Lab](https://sites.google.com/uottawa.ca/csmlab/) at the Univeristy of Ottawa's School of EECS. The language aims to enable normative monitoring of smart contracts. Smart contracts are contracts that can monitor their performance (execution). They are a Cyber Physical System (CPS) that utilizes immutable ledgers (such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Platforms, a.k.a. blockchains).

For more information about Symboleo, please refer to the preprint of our accepted paper for RE'20 conference [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXwXeLrZdaJjhSJcCrt_wBXxDvhFkq2k/view).

# Current State
The current version of the Symboleo Text Editor supports the syntax of Symboleo. It provides the capability to write Symboleo contract specifications with support for advanced features such as autocompletion and syntax highlighting.

# Future Work
Static type-checking, scoping, modularity, and code-generation features will be added in the future.
